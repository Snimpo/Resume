    <h2>About</h2>
    <p >In my role as a customer service agent, I have honed my communication skills, empathy, and patience to effectively address customer inquiries and concerns. As an administrative assistant, 
        I bring a high level of organization, attention to detail, and multitasking abilities to the table. Simultaneously,
        I am pursuing a career in software development as a student. My passion for technology and problem-solving has driven me to acquire skills in programming languages such as Python and Java.
        My combined experience as a customer service agent, administrative assistant, and software development student reflects my adaptability, strong communication skills, attention to detail, and passion for technology. 
        With a customer-centric approach and a commitment to continuous learning, I am well-equipped to excel in providing exceptional service, managing administrative tasks, and contributing to software development projects.
